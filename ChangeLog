0.01_03 Released at 2007-06-29.
        Default socket is not IO::Socket::INET, not IO::Socket::SSL.
        Added Digest::MD5 to generate an md5sum for all transports.
          Also it's possible to disable this checks or set an own and
          and faster checksum generator with option gen_check_sum.
        Added different private functions for a better code structure
          like _send, _read, _gen_check_sum and _load_digest.
