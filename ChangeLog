0.04    Released at 2007-07-05.
        Added more error handling. Now I try to return the correct error string
          because IO::Socket::SSL got advanced ssl errors.
        Fixed examples and kicked $!, $@ and $socket->sock->errstr().
        Did a lot of code improvements and pod changes.
0.03    Released at 2007-07-03.
        Added debugging availability.
        Fixed read() and send() because both breaks if the favorite
          is IO::Socket::SSL and the data length > 16384 bytes.
        Did some other code improvements.
0.02    Released at 2007-06-30.
        Did some code improvements and fixed pod typos.
        Added read_raw() and send_raw() as replacement for read(1) and send(1).
0.01_04 Released at 2007-06-29.
        Added new param to read() and send(). Now it's possible to
          give an 1 as param, it disables serializion for this one time.
        Did some other improvements.
0.01_03 Released at 2007-06-29.
        Default socket is not IO::Socket::INET, not IO::Socket::SSL.
        Added Digest::MD5 to generate an md5sum for all transports.
          Also it's possible to disable this checks or set an own and
          and faster checksum generator with option gen_check_sum.
        Added different private functions for a better code structure
          like _send, _read, _gen_check_sum and _load_digest.
